# diceware-site

A service that makes automatic password generation easy and secure.

Generated passwords are capable of meeting the majority of websites' odd password requirements, which typically require upper&lowercase letters, a number, and a symbol (this is not an endorsement of those requirements, just a tool to work within them quickly).

## Run it quickly

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  -p "127.0.0.1:29102:29102" \
  gitea.cmcode.dev/cmcode/diceware-site:latest
```

## Run it quickly, with TLS

```bash
make gen-tls-certs # requires interactive prompts to be answered
podman run --rm -it \
  -v "${PWD}/cert.pem:/cert.pem:ro" \
  -v "${PWD}/key.pem:/key.pem:ro" \
  -p "127.0.0.1:29103:29102" \
  gitea.cmcode.dev/cmcode/diceware-site:latest \
    /diceware-site -cert /cert.pem -key /key.pem -addr 0.0.0.0:29102
```

## Disclaimers

- This project uses the standard built-in Go cryptographic random number generation algorithms. That being said, I cannot guarantee that any password generated by this tool will keep you safe from being compromised.
- Additionally, the code in this project is far from perfect. I are sharing this code with the community without any warranty. Use it at your own discretion.
- This service absolutely does not store any data about its users. Frankly, I don't want your data.
